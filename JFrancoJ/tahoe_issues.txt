tahoe v1.12.1 still not working over I2P due to TLS handshake failure. This causes both sides thinks they are the client side, then fails
              this is an older issue, no well documented.
              WARNER is working on it.

SSHFS/SFTP    On mounted points caps are not always good passed, failing in creating inmutable files that are bigger than 55 bytes size.
              A workaround is to patch /inmutable/upload.py 
              patching=$(sed -e "s/URI_LIT_SIZE_THRESHOLD = 55/URI_LIT_SIZE_THRESHOLD = 55555/g" upload.py > /tmp/upload.py.patched)
              mv /tmp/upload.py.patched /home/tahoe-lafs/venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/allmydata/immutable/upload.py
              cd /home/tahoe-lafs/venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/allmydata/immutable
              python -m py_compile upload.py

              Restarting the node sometimes fix it.

              Metadata are also wrong. No patch available yet

TOR           At some time of the day, noticeable spain afternoons, Tahoe comes failing a lot, uncompleted simple tasks as just tahoe ls -l and so on,
              and unabe to complete some updates ( backing to the grid or restoring from grid )
              Tor traffic comes really VERY litle ( whatched with tcpdump ) on port 9001 , not enough to support the Tahoe service.
              This MAY be much related with SSHFS/SFTP failures on mutable/inmutable files due to timeouts inside the sshfs server.
              Yesterday seems like a bug on Tahoe/SSHFS discovered at around 16:00 localtime, and still there until 04:00 localtime, then the issues
              seems gone away.
              This morning the issue seems fixed and everything worked fine, but after 18:00 localtime the problem is back.
              I guess is much related with Tor performance at some time of the day
      
              Piece of tor/log:

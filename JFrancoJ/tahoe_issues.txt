tahoe v1.12.1 still not working over I2P due to TLS handshake failure. This causes both sides thinks they are the client side, then fails
              this is an older issue, no well documented.
              WARNER is working on it.

SSHFS/SFTP    On mounted points caps are not always good passed, failing in creating inmutable files that are bigger than 55 bytes size.
              A workaround is to patch /inmutable/upload.py 
              patching=$(sed -e "s/URI_LIT_SIZE_THRESHOLD = 55/URI_LIT_SIZE_THRESHOLD = 55555/g" upload.py > /tmp/upload.py.patched)
              mv /tmp/upload.py.patched /home/tahoe-lafs/venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/allmydata/immutable/upload.py
              cd /home/tahoe-lafs/venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/allmydata/immutable
              python -m py_compile upload.py

              Restarting the node sometimes fix it.

              Metadata are also wrong. No patch available yet

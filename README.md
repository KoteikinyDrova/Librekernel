# What the app-installation-script does?

![initial-install-workflow](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13025157/14444383/5b99d710-0045-11e6-9ae8-3efa1645f355.png)

 - Step 1. Checking user
The script should be run by user root and by console, if it was run by another user then it will warn and exit.

 - Step 2. Checking Platform
The all software intended to run on Debian 8 , so if script finds another platform it will output an error and exit.

 - Step 3. Checking Hardware
As software can be installed either on ARM boards or Physical/Virtual x86 64b machine, in this step we need to determine hardware. After determining hardware type we can determine the next step.

 - Step 4. Checking requirements
There are a list of minimum requirements that Physical/Virtual machine needs to meet.
    2 at least network interfaces (ethernet or wlan)
    4 GB of Physical memory
    16 GB of Free disk space
If machine meets the requirements then script goes to next step, otherwise it will warn and exit.


 - Step 4.2. Check if the ARM board assembled.
There are list of modules that need to be connected to ARM boards, so script will check if that modules are connected.
You can fine information about necessary modules later. If any module is missed user will get warning and script will exit.


 - Step 5. Getting DHCP client on interfaces
In this step script first DHCP request from ethX to get an ip address. If succeed, it will check for Internet connection and if Internet connection is established this step is done successfully. In any case of failure (no DHCP response or on Internet connection) script will try the same scenario for next interface. Order to try is - eth1, wlan1, eth0, wlan0 (list of available interfaces are available from step 4). Of no success in any interface, then script will warn user to plug the machine to Internet and will exit.

 - Step 6. Preparing repositories and updating sources
In this step script adds repository links for necessary packages into package manager sources and updates them. Script will output an error ant exit if it is not possible to add repositories or update sources.


 - Step 6.2. Preparing repositories and updating sources
The same as in Physical/Virtual machine case.


 - Step 7. Downloading and Installing packages
As we already have repository sources updated in step 6, so at this point script will download and install packages using package manager tools. If something goes wrong during download or installation, script will output an error ant exit.
If step 7 finished successfully it's time to run the next script “app-installation-script.sh”.


 - Step 7.2. Downloading and Installing packages
The same as in Physical/Virtual machine case.
If step 7 finished successfully then test.sh execution for odroid board is finished successfully and it's time to run the next script “app-installation-script.sh”. 
 
#Setting up a lab to start to contribute:

ESXi,VirtualBox,other vitrual lab:

Internet Router<-----eth0----Debian64----eth1---Virtual Lan vswitch<---eth---Windows10


DHCPserver--eth0---sameDebian64-----eth1--(Debian will start a dhcpserver internally)--------Win10

First of all you should install latest Debian version in a virtual machine:
- 2GB RAM, 2 procesor, 2NICs (network interfaces)


Second a non privacy friendly OS like Win 10:
- VM requirements in microsoft
- Office 2016
- All possible browsers.dropbox client, seamonkey,firefox,chrome,edge,iexplorer,opera,chromiun.

Hardware resources:

- NIC1 will be NAT/bridged to your Internet dhcp server router.
- NIC2 will be a attached  via virtual switch or vlan to the other VM Windows10. 
From debian to win 10 will be a private LAN in bridge mode. (would require promiscous because arp request from client to server)

You can use any virtualization software you prefer. Its transparent for us.

As shown in the following figure.
![deded](https://github.com/Librerouter/Librekernel/blob/gh-pages/images/21.png)

Resume of steps:

- In Virtualbox in debian like: https://jtreminio.com/2012/07/setting-up-a-debian-vm-step-by-step/
- Or any physical machine like https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-handbook/sect.installation-steps.ru.html
- In the Debian please do a Snapshot in the Virtual machine just after being install.
- go shell command console in debian and execute as root:

(Choose the wget o curl command that you prefer)

- wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Librerouter/Librekernel/gh-pages/setup.sh | bash
or
- wget -O - http://bit.ly/2gbKstn | bash

- apt-get install curl
all yes yes continue
- curl -L http://bit.ly/2gbKstn | bash

Important note before testing : 

- Do NOT try to install the scripts via ssh session.
- The scripts FAIL if you do that, due to problems with ethernet connection.
- install the scripts via direct console access.

log files are in /var

apt-get-install-aptth.log
apt-get-update.log
apt-get-install_1.log
apt-get-install_2.log
apt-get-update-default.log
libre_install.log
libre_config.log

Lab done!

Try to navigate normally from the windows 10.
Report us problems.
Investigate and play while we continue developing it.
New version of the instalaltion-configuration scripts,ISOs and OVA virtual machine export will be upcoming.

#Networking in Librerouter:

There are two bridges with two interfaces each in the machine like two bridges (only 2 separated zone NICs):
	
1. External area red bridge acting as WAN (2 nics): cable or wireless interface as DHCP client of your internet router.
2. Internal area gren bridge acting as LAN (2 nics): cable or wireless interface as an AP for being DHCP server for your new secure LAN.

- Four possible PHySICAL scenarios:

 - WAN is WiFi, LAN is WiFi
 - WAN is WiFi, LAN is Cabled Ethernet
 - WAN is Cabled Ethernet, LAN is WiFi
 - WAN is Cabled Ethernet, LAN is Cabled Ethernet

#Librerouter has 4 ways to work in the network: 

 - Server (no protection but services)
 - Network Router (services and network protection) (dont mix with NIC bridges that we have to separate 4 interfaces in 2 zones)
 
 - Passive Security Sensor (not yet done)
 - Transparent Man in the Middle Interception (hacking pentesting security testers) (not yet done)
 
##Server mode

The way networking works in Librerouter will be:

![servermode](https://github.com/Librerouter/Librekernel/blob/gh-pages/images/36.png)
 -  Fix serviceable IPs in 10.0.0.x can be wireless or Cabled Ethernet connected to the existing internet router LAN. 
 -  Server mode with both WAN and LAN interfaces in the same DMZ or VLAN or area and not threating the network traffic (not able to defend against web browsing leaks,tracking,ads and malware)
![server](https://github.com/Librerouter/Librekernel/blob/gh-pages/images/37.png)

##Router bridge mode
![bridgemode](https://github.com/Librerouter/Librekernel/blob/gh-pages/images/38.png)
Where the trafic is filtered by dns , by ip via iptables, by protocol, application layer signature and reputationally. 
![untitled](https://github.com/Librerouter/Librekernel/blob/gh-pages/images/39.png)
![bridmodeworkflow](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17382786/17251578/acd2871c-55a9-11e6-9e89-22252735ae39.png)


#How Librerouter will threat the network traffic as a Privacy Firewall in router mode (most common).

 - a) Clean network web browsing traffic (IoT, cookies tracks, scripts tracks, malware, exploits, attackes, non privacy friendly corporations web servers)
 - b) Blocking not privacy friendly protocols and inspecting inside ssl tunnels.
 - c) Monitoring for abnormal behaviours.
 - d) Offering decentralized alternatives of the such called cloud services. 
 - e) Will clean files in storage erasing metadata Sanitization (optional to classified and personal information) 
 - f) Will protect the access to your webs publically in TOR-I2P and clearnet.(normal internet).
 - g) Will selfhost search engine,email,storage,conference,collaborative,git,project managing,socialnetwork, TOR shop.

#DNS:

- Unbound-dns is the DNS SERVER hsts domain list goes to dns hsts bypass engine. 
- If it is not resolved then using cached then we use DNSCRYPT to ask D.I.A.N.A and OpenNIC.
- If it can not resolved, then we need to ask through TOR aleatory.
- Further integration will include Bitname,others like DjDNS (this last need maintenance is not workinghttps://github.com/DJDNS/djdns)).

![dnsipdate](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17382786/17974085/ec54e6b4-6ae4-11e6-9efb-bf2352520459.png)
 
  * Search engines  - will be resolved to ip address 10.0.0.251 (Yacy) by unbound. and hsts downgraded and dns hardredirected.
  * Social network  - will be resolved to ip address 10.0.0.252 (friendics) by unbound. and hsts downgraded and dns hardredirected.
  * Online Storage  - Will be resolved to ip address 10.0.0.253 (Owncloud) by unbound. and hsts downgraded and dns hardredirected.
  * Webmails        - Will be resolved to ip address 10.0.0.254 (MailPile) by unbound. and hsts downgraded and dns hardredirected.

#### Darknets Domains:
 
  * .local - will be resolved to local ip address (10.0.0.0/24 network) by unbound.
  * .i2p   - will be resolved to ip address 10.191.0.1 by unbound.
  * .onion - unbound will forward this zone to Tor DNS running on 10.0.0.1:9053

# Modsecurity for Hidenservices and direct clearnet published NAT services

# Suricata Intrusion Prevention System Ruleset versus use cases configuration.

When user is using HTTPS connection to a darknet domain, this traffic it's considered dangerus and insecure. (the goverment try to explodes the browser for deanonymization) On darknet onion and i2p domains, squid will open the SSL tunnel and inspect for possible exploits, virus and attacks to the user.
If this connection it's to a HTTPS regular/banking domain, this SSL tunnel will be not open Bumped/inspected. Will be routed directly to the clearnet internet (ex: https://yourbank.com)

When the user is using HTTP, because is considered insecure itself this clear traffic is going to go through TOR to add anonymization but after a threatment from the local engines to add privacy on it.. The user can also decide in the future about which things he dont want to use TOr for HTTP.
To provide full internet security, we want IDS/IPS to inspect all kind of communications in our network: tor, i2p and direct.
But we also want to inspect all secure connections. To do so, we use squid proxy with ssl-bump feature to perform mitm.
All decrypted traffic goes to icap server, where it's being scanned by clam antivirus.

To accomplish our goal, we are going to make Suricata listen on two interfaces:
 -  On LAN Suricata is going to detect potentially bad traffic (incoming and outgoing), block attackers/compromised hosts, tor exit nodes, etc.
Suricata will inspect packets using default sets of rules: 
  Botnet Command and Control Server Rules (BotCC),
  ciarmy.com Top Attackers List,
  Known CompromisedHost List,
  Spamhaus.org DROP List,
  Dshield Top Attackers List,
  Tor exit Nodes List,
  Protocol events List.
 -  On localhost Suricata is supposed to scan icap port for bad content: browser/activex exploits, malware, attacks, etc.
Modified emerging signatures for browsers will be implemented for this purpose.

**Loopback issue:**

Suricata >=3.1 is unable to listen on loopback in afp mode. When run with -i lo option, it dies with this messages:

\<Error\> - [ERRCODE: SC_ERR_INVALID_VALUE(130)] - Frame size bigger than block size

\<Error\> - [ERRCODE: SC_ERR_AFP_CREATE(190)] - Couldn't init AF_PACKET socket, fatal error

Same configuration works fine with Suricata v3.0.0.

**Possible solutions:**

- Use pcap mode on lo and af-packet on eth0. May not be possible, because since 3.1 Suricata use af-packet mode by default
- Reduce the MTU size

###HSTS 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security

Problem: when a use uses the google/bing search by a direct query keyword in the browsers
The browser enfoces hsts then the certificate from our redirected yacy fails.
Then we cant inspect the traffic for this big list of domains:
https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/net/http/transport_security_state_static.json
We inspect for protecting the browser against exploitation of bugs and attacks.
Who can guaranteed this entities are not doing it?

We inspect the HSTS domains with Snort,Suricata BRO and CLamAV via ICAP CCAP and Squid bumping

The problem is that the redirection we made when the user tries gmail for instance in to local service mailpile fails with multiple browser because hsts.

Why we redirect gmail to mailpile or roundcube? obvious we offer s elfhosted solution better than corporate centralized.

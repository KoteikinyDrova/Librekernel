First, install all python dependencies from requirements.txt

Then, Follow these instructions to generate bank ips

1) python bgp.py
**This will generate a file called bank_as.json**

2) sudo python rdns.py bank_as.json
**This will take a long time to run. It also requires sudo privileges for port scanning.
This will generate a file called bank_as.json.dns**

3) python subd.py bank_as.json.dns bank_domains &> bank_subdomains
**bank_domains is the file of bank domain names that can be added to easily
This will take a long time to run as well**

4) python ip_gen.py bank_as.json.dns bank_subdomains &> bank_ips
**This will not take a long time at all**
